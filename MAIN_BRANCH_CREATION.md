# Main Branch Creation

## Status
The `main` branch has been successfully created locally from the initial commit (18bf517).

## Local Branch Status
```
* main (at commit 18bf517 - Initial commit)
```

## Next Steps
To complete the main branch setup on the remote repository, a repository administrator needs to:

1. Push the main branch to the remote:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin main
   ```

2. (Optional) Set main as the default branch in GitHub repository settings:
   - Go to repository Settings → Branches
   - Change default branch to `main`

## Current Branch Structure
- `main` - Created from initial commit (local only)
- `copilot/create-main-branch` - Current PR branch

The main branch is ready and exists locally in the repository.
